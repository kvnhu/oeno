# oeno

Wine has heatedly subjective spectrums of flavors, mouthfeels, aromas, and other characteristics.

Reviews of wine pick out nuances that are, to an untrained enjoyer like myself, comically difficult to discern. But these details might be useful, even if I can't discern the exact notes that experienced connoisseurs can.

Hypothesis: the vocabulary and language used by critics can inform a wine recommender significantly better than a single-dimensional numerical rating can.
